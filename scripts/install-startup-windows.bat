REM  Forensic Analyst — Frontend autostart installer (Windows)
REM
REM  Drops a launcher into your Startup folder. That is it.
REM
REM  Just double-click this file. No administrator, no Task
REM  Scheduler, no service.
REM
REM  Why the Startup folder and not a Scheduled Task: the task ran
REM  as SYSTEM at boot, which has its own PATH (no per-user Node),
REM  its own session, a battery policy that blocks it on laptops
REM  and a 3-day run limit. This runs as YOU, right after you log
REM  in, with your PATH — the same environment where it already
REM  works when you start it by hand.
REM
REM  Trade-off: it starts when you log in, not before. If nobody
REM  logs in, nothing runs.
