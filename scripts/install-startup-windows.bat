REM  Forensic Analyst — Frontend boot autostart installer (cmd)
REM
REM  Registers a Scheduled Task that runs scripts\start-windows.bat
REM  at system boot. Run this from an ELEVATED Command Prompt
REM  (Right-click -> "Run as administrator"):
REM
REM      scripts\install-startup-windows.bat
REM
REM  Refuses to run without admin rights, and verifies the task
REM  afterwards instead of assuming it took.
